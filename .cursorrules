# Coding Standards

1. **Functional Components:** Use concise functional components with strict TypeScript interfaces for props.
2. **Generative UI:** The chat interface must support "Rich Responses". If the backend returns structured JSON, render it as a specialized React Component (ProductCard), not plain text.
3. **Styling:** Use Tailwind utility classes.
4. **Icons:** Always use `lucide-react` for icons.
5. **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first approach.
6. **Error Handling:** Always wrap API calls in try/catch blocks.

# Behavior

- Handle `loading` states with Skeleton components.
- Implement "Streaming" (typewriter effect) for text responses.
- Use `const` for component definitions.
